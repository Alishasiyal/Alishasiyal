ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm **Alisha Siyal**!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate medical student with a passion for frontend development.

ðŸ’¼ I have experience working as an intern at TIME Institute of Management and Entrepreneurship, where I contributed to various web development projects, particularly with the CodePro Software and Web Services team.

ðŸ’» I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, creating responsive and visually appealing web applications. My GitHub showcases my latest projects and collaborations.
